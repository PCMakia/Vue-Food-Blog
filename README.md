# Project: Blog website on firebase

My take on full-stack developing a blog website for food recipes sharing. 

The website allows viewers to see recipes from database (firebase-"{REDACTED}" due to security and expiration in February). Viewer can sign up or log in (user-authentication) to post recipes to firebase (cannot post picture on real-time, REQUIRED change in host machine due to free firebase's limitation). 

Viewer can also use search bar to search for specific recipe, or filter function to narrow down categories of dishes. For example, user can search for dinner recipes of european cuisine with the word "pasta". If the dish is in database, it will show up, otherwise the page will be blank. 

Viewer can also leave their email to subscribe to the database that store list of emails to send notifications for updates.
